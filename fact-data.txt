The fastest man-made object on Earth was a manhole cover. While performing an underground nuclear test in 1957, it was 4 inches thick and fastened over a 500-foot hole in the ground where the bomb was detonated. The explosion was recorded by a camera that captured one frame per millisecond. The pressure from the explosion caused the cover to fly off so fast that it only appeared in one frame. Using this information along with the dimensions of the frame, it was determined that the manhole cover exceeded 130,000 mph, which is enough velocity to launch it into space.
